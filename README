  This beta version consists on two codes:

  a FORTRAN code that:
    1) Creates N cells with their own 2D position
    2) Gives them a random speed at every step
    3) Calculates a new location based on the speed and a time parameter
    4) Saves the cell collection's positions on a "library" gallery

  a PYTHON code that:
    1) Plots the locations of the cells using the voronoi idealization
    2) Stores each frame into a "gallery" directory
